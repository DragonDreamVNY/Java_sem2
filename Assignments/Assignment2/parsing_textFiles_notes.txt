parsing text files - Tokeniser and Streams

Token files
1st , 2nd, 3rd, 4th

parsing the files into tokens
reading and analysing tokens in the file

where Stream lets us read/write to file.
parsing
Stream tokeniser
//tokeniser is similar to split() method where it returns something like an array

Token Types / constants:
TT_WORD
The token is a word.

• TT_NUMBER
The token is a number.

• TT_EOL
The end of the line has been read.

• TT_EOF
The end of the file has been read



StreamTokenizer Variables

• int ttype
Contains the current token type, which matches one of the constants listed on the preceding slide.

• double nval
Contains the value of the current token if that token is a number.

• String sval
Contains a string that gives the characters of the current token if that token is a word.


public int nextToken() throws IOException
• Parses the next token from the input stream of this
StreamTokenizer.
• The type of the next token is returned in the
ttype field.
• If ttype == TT_WORD, the token is stored in sval.
• If ttype == TT_NUMBER, the token is stored in nval.

EXAMPLE 4 notes:
StreamTokenizer

wrap FileReader object with SteamTokenizer to break information into Tokens.
wrap FileWriter object with PrintWriter object

in parsing files example:
NB info isn't written in second file until Stream is closed: information will never be written

======================

EXERCISE 1
weather Token exercise

read
parse contents of that file
program tests for invalid file structure


	I


print file to
3 column headings
county
avg daily temp for each county (1 decimal place)
freeze risk based on avg daily temp (<=0) Print YES otherwise Print NO

program end -> second file should have output
County 		Average Daily Temp 		Freeze Risk
Clare			2						NO
Cork			1.5						NO
etc


NB need to parse headers
========================
EXERCISE 2
cars.dat
- parse this file
- print to second file 'projections.dat'
locations, Average Price of Car at that location

second file will have :
Location 		AveragePrice
DUBLIN			3,221,321.00
Cork        3,242,234.20
