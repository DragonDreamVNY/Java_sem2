Hans Peter Luhn 'Mod-10 algorithm' /' Mod-10 formula' - validating credit cards
Luhn test: see: https://repl.it/FewU/9


first : reverse the number you are tryng to validate
- valid MasterCards starts with the prefix of 51, 53 or 55
- All valid Visa cards must start with the number 4.
- All credit card numbers have 16 digits

skip the tokens that don't "need" validation, then pass the CC into the validation method
